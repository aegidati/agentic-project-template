# Starter Packs

This directory contains **metadata and references** to available starter packs.

**Do not put application code here.** Starter packs are installed into the `app/` folder using the methods described in [docs/architecture/STARTER-PACKS.md](../docs/architecture/STARTER-PACKS.md).

## Available Starter Packs

| Starter Pack | Technology Stack | Installation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| agentic-clean-backend | Clean Architecture backend | `app/backend` | Official |
| agentic-dotnet-backend | .NET backend | `app/backend` | Official |
| agentic-react-spa | React SPA web client | `app/web` | Official |
| agentic-angular-spa | Angular SPA web client | `app/web` | Official |
| agentic-flutter-client | Flutter cross-platform client | `app/client` | Official |

| agentic-fullstack-composition | Fullstack Docker composition | `app/composition` | Official |
| agentic-iam | Documentation-first IAM foundation | manual-copy or subtree-vendor (docs + governance artifacts) | Official |

Backend and web are alternative starters per slot canonico while keeping canonical install paths unchanged.

Foundation starters are manual-adoption modules and are not installed into runtime `app/*` slots.
