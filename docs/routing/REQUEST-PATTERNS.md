# Request Patterns

This document provides concrete routing examples for the AI agents of the Agentic development platform.

Its purpose is to make agent selection predictable and consistent.

For each request pattern, this document defines:

- the request type
- the primary agent
- optional supporting agents
- the authoritative documents to consult
- the expected outcome

This file complements:

- docs/routing/AGENT-ROUTING.md
- docs/routing/ROUTING-MAP.md
- docs/platform/AGENT-RESPONSIBILITIES.md

# 9. Default Routing Heuristics

If the request is about installing or composing modules, use:

- starter-installer

If the request is about feature planning or workflow progress, use:

- feature-orchestrator

If the request is about structure, boundaries, or ADRs, use:

- architecture-guardian

If the request is about missing docs or release documentation, use:

- documentation-guardian

If the request is about tests, testability, or Definition of Done from a QA perspective, use:

---

# 10. Routing Constraints

- Do not use starter-installer for feature planning.
- Do not use feature-orchestrator for starter installation.
- Do not use documentation-guardian as architecture authority.
- Do not use ux-navigator for backend-only technical changes unless they affect user-facing behavior.
- Do not use domain-template for implementation details outside domain modeling.
